# React Native Performance

## Memoization

- Use `React.memo()` for list items (like `LeagueCard.tsx`) to prevent unnecessary re-renders.
- Use `useCallback` for functions passed as props to memoized components.
- Use `useMemo` for expensive calculations (like formatting league stats).

## Images

- Always use `expo-image` instead of the standard `Image` component.
- Provide a `placeholder` and set a `cachePolicy` (prefer `memory-disk`).
- Handle `onError` events by logging to Sentry.

## Layout

- Avoid inline objects in props (e.g., `style={{ margin: 10 }}`) inside loops; define them outside or use NativeWind.
- Use `NativeWind` classes (Tailwind) as they are optimized for React Native performance.
