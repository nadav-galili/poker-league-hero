# Mixpanel Tracking

When creating or updating screens:

1. Import `useMixpanel` from `hooks/useMixpanel.ts`
2. Track relevant user events (screen views, interactions, conversions)
3. If event type doesn't exist in the hook, add it there first — don't inline custom events

## Example

```tsx
const { trackScreenView, trackButtonPress } = useMixpanel();

useEffect(() => {
   trackScreenView('ProfileScreen');
}, []);
```

## Event Naming Convention

- Screen views: `screen_<name>` (e.g., `screen_profile`)
- Actions: `<action>_<target>` (e.g., `tap_save_button`, `submit_form`)
- Keep snake_case, lowercase
