# Bun Package Management

ðŸš€ **Always use these bun commands instead of npm:**

- `bun install` (not `npm install`)
- `bun add <package>` (not `npm install <package>`)
- `bun remove <package>` (not `npm uninstall <package>`)
- `bun run <script>` (not `npm run <script>`)

## Important Notes:

- The app structure is clean and consistent with bun
- Only `bun.lock` should exist (no `package-lock.json` or `yarn.lock`)
- All dependencies should be installed via bun to maintain consistency
- Use `bun run start` to start the Expo development server

## Troubleshooting:

If you encounter mixed package manager issues:

1. Remove `package-lock.json` and `yarn.lock` if they exist
2. Delete `node_modules`
3. Run `bun install` to reinstall all dependencies cleanly
